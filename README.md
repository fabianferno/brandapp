## Project Description
A comprehensive built-in digital asset management which allows assets to be centralized in a decentralized way so they can be used in the right way at the right time.

## Inspiration
From looking for lost logos to customize them following the brand guidelines, it is arduous to have and track them all under one roof. Although there are few DAM softwares, we wanted to provide a solution where each digital brand will be treated as an digital asset through NFT by centralizing them in a decentralized way.


## What it does
Brandapp is a comprehensive built-in DAM which enables users to bulk upload, store, centralise, track, and customize all your brand assets and unlimited files in a single click. It let's you define your brand collateral based on your organisationâ€™s guidelines making it flexible-to-use. Additionally, it paves the way for creative martech allowing you to view other brand's templates. 
It's unrivaled benefit is that each brand will be minted as NFTs. 


## How we built in
The platform is built using Reactjs, IPFS and Solidity. Organizations that need a platform for brand guidelines can add their guidelines in this platform by connecting their metamask wallets. Once logged in, they can create and view brand guidelines. On creating brand guidelines all the  metadata is stored in IPFS via Filecoin using WebStorage. The NFT smart contract takes care of data upload and is unique as each data is non-fungable. It is decentalized as it uses IPFS.
