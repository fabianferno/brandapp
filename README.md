## Project Description
A comprehensive built-in digital asset management which allows assets to be centralized in a decentralized way so they can be used in the right way at the right time.

## Inspiration
From looking for lost logos to customize them following the brand guidelines, it is arduous to have and track them all under one roof. Although there are few DAM softwares, we wanted to provide a solution where each digital brand will be treated as an digital asset through NFT by centralizing them in a decentralized way.


## What it does
Brandapp is a comprehensive built-in DAM which enables users to bulk upload, store, centralise, track, and customize all your brand assets and unlimited files in a single click. It let's you define your brand collateral based on your organisationâ€™s guidelines making it flexible-to-use. Additionally, it paves the way for creative martech allowing you to view other brand's templates. 
It's unrivaled benefit is that each brand will be minted as NFTs. 


## How we built in
It has a "React" front end that efficiently makes use of a Bootstrap Design System. Our file uploads go directly into the IPFS providing a decentralized storage solution persisted via Filecoin. The smart contracts were written in assembly-script, along with Polygon which does the minting process in the network.
